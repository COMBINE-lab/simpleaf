``inspect`` command
===================

The ``inspect`` command simply inspects the ``ALEVIN_FRY_HOME`` directory, and prints to the console the relevant information contained therein.  Specifically, it will print the paths currently being used for the ``salmon``, ``alevin-fry``, and ``pyroe`` programs, as well as the versions of these tools.  Further, if a ``custom_chemistries.json`` file is present, it will print the contents of this file.  This command can be invoked as:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ simpleaf inspect

Currently, this command takes no arguments or options.
