simpleaf workflow commands
==========================

The ``simpleaf workflow`` program exposes a number of different commands that are responsible for exposing different capabilities. The list of current and valid commands are documented below.

Besides, we also provides a *simpleaf workflow utility* library for developers, which contains useful functions for workflow template development. The simpleaf team has been continously improving existing functions and adding new funtion into this library. The codebase is included in `protocol esturary <https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/protocol-estuary/blob/main/utils/simpleaf_workflow_utils.libsonnet>`_.
