# simpleaf

A rust framework to make using alevin-fry _even_ simpler.

The `simpleaf` program can be installed from source, from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/simpleaf), or installed via [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/simpleaf/README.html).  If installed via `bioconda` the relevant dependencies will also be installed.
Otherwise, `simpleaf` requires [`pyroe`](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pyroe), [`salmon`](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon), and [`alevin-fry`](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/alevin-fry), as well as `wget`.

Check out the documentation [here](https://simpleaf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
