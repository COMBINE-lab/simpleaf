# simpleaf

A rust framework to make using alevin-fry _even_ simpler. `simpleaf` encapsulates the process of creating an expanded reference for quantification into a single command (`index`) and the quantification of a sample into a single command (`quant`). The `simpleaf` program can be installed from source, from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/simpleaf), or installed via [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/simpleaf/README.html). ][Check here for installation guides](https://simpleaf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). 

A end-to-end example showing the usage of simpleaf can be found in the tutorial [Generating a scRNA-seq count matrix with simpleaf](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-fry-tutorials/2023/simpleaf-piscem). In the same tutorial we also showed how to run `simpleaf` from the [usefulaf](https://hub.docker.com/r/combinelab/usefulaf/tags) dock/singularity image.
