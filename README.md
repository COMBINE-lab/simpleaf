# simpleaf

A rust framework to make using alevin-fry _even_ simpler. `simpleaf` encapsulates the process of creating an expanded reference for quantification into a single command (`index`) and the quantification of a sample into a single command (`quant`).

The `simpleaf` program can be installed from source, from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/simpleaf), or installed via [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/simpleaf/README.html). `simpleaf` requires [`pyroe`](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pyroe), [`alevin-fry`](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/alevin-fry), and either [`piscem`](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/piscem) or [`salmon`](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon) (or both if you prefer), as well as `wget`.
